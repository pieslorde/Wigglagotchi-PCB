# Wigglagotchi-PCB
This repository contains the Altium Designer AD22 source files and generated Gerber, NC drill, and
documentation files for PCB of the Wigglagotchi. The enclosure for the device is maintained in
[Wigglagotchi-Mechanical](https://github.com/pieslorde/Wigglagotchi-Mechanical). The Wigglagotchi
is an open-source handheld gaming device with three buttons, a screen, an IMU, a buzzer, and an
IrDA transceiver to communicate with other Wigglagotchis.

The namesake of the Wigglagotchi is the Twitch streamer [Keffals](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffals).
A frequent feature of her community is an [animated chibi-style version of herself
dancing](https://twitter.com/keffals/status/1509562415096213510), or wiggling. Chatters who use the emote are referred
to as "Wigglers", and the Wigglagotchi was designed to support virtual Wiggler pets for the user.

A document containing 3D renders of the assembled PCB, a BOM, and the schematic is
[included here](https://github.com/pieslorde/Wigglagotchi-PCB/blob/main/Project%20Outputs%20for%20Wigglagotchi/Documentation.PDF).
